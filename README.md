# Personal Dotfiles

Hello! Here are my personal dotfiles.

- `.zshrc`: My personal config for [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- `.vimrc`: My vim config based on [this Laracasts series](https://laracasts.com/series/vim-mastery)
- `.gitignore`: Global gitignore file. See [this link](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/setting-up-a-global-gitignore-file/) for info.

If you want to go all in on dotfiles, check out Dries Vints' [screencast here](https://laracasts.com/series/guest-spotlight/episodes/1).

If you want to share your dotfiles, check out [this article here](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/move-your-dotfiles-version-control) which explains how to do it.
